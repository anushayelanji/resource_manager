# Resource Manager
This project develops a simple process and resource manager. The manager supports the creation and management of the data structures to represent processes and resources. The manager also provides the operations invoked by processes to create and destroy processes, and to request and release resources. A manually invoked timeout function mimics the behavior of preemptive scheduling.
